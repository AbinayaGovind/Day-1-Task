1.  Question:  Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2   
     Answer:    HTTP/1.1 loads the ressources one after the other, i.e, the request and responses will go back and forth betweeen server and client until the web browser
                     receive all the resources necessary to open the HTML page. Messages are transformed as plain text messages.
                HTTP/2 sends all the resources at once using the TCP/IP connection, so that no resources will blocks web browser to open the HTML page. It uses binary
                     framing format to transfer the messages.
